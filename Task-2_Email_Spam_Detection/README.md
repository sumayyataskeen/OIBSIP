# Email Spam Detection
# Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting spam and non-spam (ham) emails using machine learning techniques and text processing methods.
# Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a reliable machine learning model that can classify email messages as spam or ham based on their content.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains email messages labeled as spam or ham.
# Methodology
- Performed text preprocessing and cleaning
- Converted text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization
- Trained a Logistic Regression model for classification
- Evaluated the model using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and visual analysis
- Analyzed class distribution and prediction performance
# Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
# Conclusion
The email spam detection model was successfully built using machine learning and TF-IDF text vectorization. Logistic Regression performed well, achieving high accuracy and effectively distinguishing between spam and ham messages. The confusion matrix and class distribution graphs show that the model correctly identified most messages with very few misclassifications. Overall, the model is reliable for basic spam detection tasks and demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in text classification.
