# Iris Flower Classification
# Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into different species using machine learning based on flower measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
# Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flower species and understand which features contribute most to the prediction.
# Dataset
The Iris dataset is used in this project. It contains measurements of iris flowers along with their corresponding species labels.
# Methodology
- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed feature importance to understand the impact of different features
- Trained a Random Forest classification model
- Evaluated the model performance
# Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
# Conclusion
Working on this project helped me understand how machine learning can be used to classify flowers based on simple measurements. During the analysis, I observed that petal-related features, especially petal length and petal width, have the strongest impact on species classification.

Using this understanding, a Random Forest model was trained, which performed very well and accurately predicted the flower species. Overall, this project provided practical experience in exploratory data analysis, feature importance analysis, and machine learning classification, and demonstrated how models learn patterns from data to make predictions.
